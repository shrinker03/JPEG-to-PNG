# JPEG-to-PNG
I have created a python script to convert your jpeg image into png. You have to just provide it a folder location where your images is saved and boom.. your image will be converted into png.  
/// How to convert your imgae ///

You have to provide just image folder and a new folder following by this python script :- e.g., python jpeg_to_png.py [folder_name/] [new_folder_name/]
